# hngx_1

HNGX stage 1 task.

## Introduction

This project is a 2-page Flutter app. The first page shows an image (which is also the slack profile picture), a name (corresponding to the slack username) and a button with title 'Open GitHub' that opens the second page which is a webview of my Github page. 

## Installation
Minimum SDk is set to 19, so app will not run on devices running lower SDk versions.
- Clone the repo
- run 'flutter pub get' to get all the packages and dependecies
- run the command 'flutter run'

## Assumptions
It was assumed that the slack image to be displayed doesn't have to be sourced from Slack rather just an image that matches the profile picture on slack.

## Packages used
The only external package used is the webview_flutter package.
